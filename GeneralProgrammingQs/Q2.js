// I have not studied computer Science formula and I have only been coding (properly)
// for maybe a year or so


// I normally use Objects to handle that in JS like this:

const laptops = 
    {
        "Apple":"Macbook Pro",
        "Microsoft":"Surface Pro",
        "Dell":"XPS"
    }

console.log(laptops.Apple);


// However, I am very keen on leanring more computer science
// knowledge and strengthening my fundementals.

### <a name="gq1-a1"> Q1 - attempt1</a>
   In my first attempt I realised that every third value is even.
   So I just tried to hard code it at first by finding the even terms of the fibonacci sequence then adding them up.  
   This obviously isn't the most efficient and wouldn't give me the sum of the first 100 even terms quick enough!
### <a name="gq1-a2"> Q1 - attempt2</a>
   So I began researching on Maths Stack exchange, I did __not__ want to cheat! I was looking for a theorem that I could code up and then I found this: [Closed form for the sum of even fibonacci numbers?](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/323058/closed-form-for-the-sum-of-even-fibonacci-numbers?utm_medium=organic&utm_source=google_rich_qa&utm_campaign=google_rich_qa).
